# discordWebhookSender
A discord webhook interface for the web.

You can use the project [here!](https://epoktarren.github.io/discordWebhookSender/)
I recommend this slightly less corwded version for mobile [here!](https://epoktarren.github.io/discordWebhookSender/mobile.html)

This project isn't super serious but if anyone finds any issues please report them.
